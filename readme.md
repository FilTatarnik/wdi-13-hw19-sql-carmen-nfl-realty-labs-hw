#### Tonight's homework is three-fold

#### Part 1: Carmen Sandiego

This assignment will get you comfortable with queries. Start your SQL
explorations here.

Follow the [readme.md](carmen-sandiego/readme.md) in the carmen-sandiego folder and put your answers in `find_carmen.sql` (more details in the associated readme).

**Strong Recommendation:** Make finding Carmen Sandiego way more fun and fast by partnering up! Work with at least one other person, ask the evening TA to make a breakout room or make your own Zoom room!

#### Part 2: NFL

This assignment will give you more practice with queries, and get
you to deal with some more advanced parts of the sql language. Start this after having completed Carmen Sandiego.

Follow the [readme.md](nfl/readme.md) in the nfl folder and put your answers in the `nfl.sql` file (more details in the associated readme).

#### Part 3: Realty

This assignment will expose you to modeling your data, and manually
creating tables and seeding you database.

Follow the [readme.md](realty/readme.md) in the realty folder and put your answers in the `realty_schema.sql`, `realty_seed.sql` and `realty.sql` files (more details in the associated readme)
